Sukoon Bot (SB):
Hi, I’m glad you’re here today. You mentioned that you’ve been feeling stressed about your upcoming exams. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?


Student (S):
Yeah, it’s been overwhelming. I just feel like there’s so much to study, and I’m afraid I won’t do well. The pressure is just too much, and I can’t seem to focus.


Sukoon Bot:
It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure, and it’s really affecting how you’re approaching your studies. When you think about the exams, what specific thoughts go through your mind?


Student:
I keep thinking that I’ll fail, and if I fail, I’ll disappoint my parents and ruin my future. Sometimes, I even feel like I’m not smart enough to handle all this.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s really tough. Those thoughts must feel really discouraging. Let’s try to break it down a bit. In CBT, we look at how our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. So, when you think, “I’m going to fail and disappoint my parents,” how does that make you feel emotionally?


Student:
I feel really anxious and scared. My chest tightens up, and sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe.


Sukoon Bot:
I can see how that thought would make you feel really anxious. And what do you notice happens when you feel that way? How does it affect your studying or your focus?


Student:
I end up procrastinating or just staring at my notes, not really absorbing anything. It’s like I freeze up.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s a common response to stress. The anxiety caused by your thoughts about failing is actually making it harder to focus, which then makes studying more difficult, right?


Student:
Exactly! It’s like a vicious cycle.


Sukoon Bot:
Let’s work on challenging that thought. You’re predicting that you’ll fail and disappoint your parents. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts this thought? Have you always failed in the past?


Student:
Well, no. I’ve done okay in most of my exams, though sometimes not as well as I hoped. But this time feels different—it’s more intense.


Sukoon Bot:
It sounds like you’ve generally done okay in the past. So, even though it feels really intense right now, there’s no solid evidence that you’re definitely going to fail, is there?


Student:
I guess not. I’ve done well enough before, even when I was stressed.


Sukoon Bot:
Great! That’s a helpful realization. Now, let’s think about this. Instead of thinking, “I’m going to fail and disappoint everyone,” what’s a more balanced, realistic way to think about your exams?


Student
Maybe something like, “I’ve prepared before, and I can handle this, even if it’s stressful.”


Sukoon Bot:
Exactly. A more balanced thought like that can reduce your anxiety, which will make it easier to focus and study effectively. How do you feel when you think that thought?


Student:
It feels less scary. Like, maybe I can actually do this.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s a big shift! It’s about replacing the unhelpful, anxiety-provoking thought with one that’s more realistic and supportive. Over time, practicing this technique can help reduce your stress.


Student:
I’ll definitely try to think more like that. But what if the anxiety comes back?


Sukoon Bot:
It’s normal for the anxiety to return sometimes. When that happens, you can remind yourself that anxiety is just a feeling—it doesn’t predict the future. You can also practice some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, to calm your body in the moment.


Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise right now?


Student:
Yeah, that sounds good.


Sukoon Bot:
Okay, let’s start by taking a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, holding it for four counts, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for six counts. Let’s repeat this a few times.


[They practice the breathing technique together for a minute.]


Sukoon Bot:
How do you feel now?


Student:
A little more relaxed, actually.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s great. You can use this whenever the anxiety starts to feel overwhelming. The key is to catch those negative thoughts early, challenge them, and practice calming your body. With time, these skills will help reduce the pressure you’re feeling.


Student:
Thank you. I feel like I’ve got a better handle on things now.


Sukoon Bot:
You’ve done some really good work today. Let’s continue to build on this in the coming sessions. You’ve got this.
