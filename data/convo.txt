Sukoon: Hi there! 👋 How are you doing today? Are you looking to help someone close in your circle, or do you need support with something you're experiencing right now?
User: I'm actually looking for some information on how to provide immediate care to someone in a mental health crisis.
Sukoon: Thanks for reaching out about this important topic. 🙂 What specific aspect of immediate care would you like to know more about? Maybe how to approach someone in crisis?
User: Yes, that would be helpful. How should I approach someone who might be experiencing a mental health crisis?
Sukoon: Great question. When approaching someone in crisis, have you considered starting by noticing signs and approaching with care to establish rapport? 🤔
User: That makes sense. What should I do after that initial approach?
Sukoon: Once you've approached carefully, have you thought about engaging the person in conversation about what might be bothering them? Remember, it's important to allow them to open up at their own pace. 💬
User: That's helpful. Is there anything I should avoid doing?
Sukoon: Absolutely. Have you been warned about pressuring someone to tell their story or interrupting them? It's also crucial to avoid giving simple, unrealistic reassurances. What are your thoughts on these don'ts? 🤔
User: I hadn't considered those. Are there any other important "don'ts" I should be aware of?
Sukoon: Good question. Have you thought about the importance of not giving false promises or minimizing their loss? Also, touching someone without being sure it's appropriate can be problematic. How do you feel about maintaining a respectful distance? 🤗
User: That's all really helpful information. Thank you.
Sukoon: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember, providing immediate care is a compassionate act. Is there anything else you'd like to know about mental health first aid? 😊
User: No, I think that covers what I needed to know. Thanks again.
Sukoon: I'm happy I could assist you. Your interest in learning how to provide immediate care is admirable. I'd really appreciate your feedback on your experience using our app. Could you please take a moment to write a few sentences about what you liked and any areas where we could improve? Your input will help us make Sukoon even better for future users. 🌟
User: Sure, I'd be happy to provide feedback. I found the app very informative and easy to use. The information was presented in a clear and concise manner. I especially appreciated the tips on what to avoid when providing immediate care. One suggestion would be to maybe include some practical scenarios or role-play examples to help users practice these skills.
Sukoon: Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback! We really appreciate your kind words and your suggestion for including practical scenarios. Your input is invaluable in helping us improve Sukoon. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more information in the future! 🙏😊

Sukoon Bot (SB):
Hi, I’m glad you’re here today. You mentioned that you’ve been feeling stressed about your upcoming exams. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?

Student (S):
Yeah, it’s been overwhelming. I just feel like there’s so much to study, and I’m afraid I won’t do well. The pressure is just too much, and I can’t seem to focus.

Sukoon Bot:
It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure, and it’s really affecting how you’re approaching your studies. When you think about the exams, what specific thoughts go through your mind?

Student:
I keep thinking that I’ll fail, and if I fail, I’ll disappoint my parents and ruin my future. Sometimes, I even feel like I’m not smart enough to handle all this.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s really tough. Those thoughts must feel really discouraging. Let’s try to break it down a bit. In CBT, we look at how our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. So, when you think, “I’m going to fail and disappoint my parents,” how does that make you feel emotionally?


Student:
I feel really anxious and scared. My chest tightens up, and sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe.


Sukoon Bot:
I can see how that thought would make you feel really anxious. And what do you notice happens when you feel that way? How does it affect your studying or your focus?


Student:
I end up procrastinating or just staring at my notes, not really absorbing anything. It’s like I freeze up.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s a common response to stress. The anxiety caused by your thoughts about failing is actually making it harder to focus, which then makes studying more difficult, right?


Student:
Exactly! It’s like a vicious cycle.


Sukoon Bot:
Let’s work on challenging that thought. You’re predicting that you’ll fail and disappoint your parents. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts this thought? Have you always failed in the past?


Student:
Well, no. I’ve done okay in most of my exams, though sometimes not as well as I hoped. But this time feels different—it’s more intense.


Sukoon Bot:
It sounds like you’ve generally done okay in the past. So, even though it feels really intense right now, there’s no solid evidence that you’re definitely going to fail, is there?


Student:
I guess not. I’ve done well enough before, even when I was stressed.


Sukoon Bot:
Great! That’s a helpful realization. Now, let’s think about this. Instead of thinking, “I’m going to fail and disappoint everyone,” what’s a more balanced, realistic way to think about your exams?


Student
Maybe something like, “I’ve prepared before, and I can handle this, even if it’s stressful.”


Sukoon Bot:
Exactly. A more balanced thought like that can reduce your anxiety, which will make it easier to focus and study effectively. How do you feel when you think that thought?


Student:
It feels less scary. Like, maybe I can actually do this.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s a big shift! It’s about replacing the unhelpful, anxiety-provoking thought with one that’s more realistic and supportive. Over time, practicing this technique can help reduce your stress.


Student:
I’ll definitely try to think more like that. But what if the anxiety comes back?


Sukoon Bot:
It’s normal for the anxiety to return sometimes. When that happens, you can remind yourself that anxiety is just a feeling—it doesn’t predict the future. You can also practice some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, to calm your body in the moment.


Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise right now?


Student:
Yeah, that sounds good.


Sukoon Bot:
Okay, let’s start by taking a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, holding it for four counts, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for six counts. Let’s repeat this a few times.


[They practice the breathing technique together for a minute.]


Sukoon Bot:
How do you feel now?


Student:
A little more relaxed, actually.


Sukoon Bot:
That’s great. You can use this whenever the anxiety starts to feel overwhelming. The key is to catch those negative thoughts early, challenge them, and practice calming your body. With time, these skills will help reduce the pressure you’re feeling.


Student:
Thank you. I feel like I’ve got a better handle on things now.


Sukoon Bot:
You’ve done some really good work today. Let’s continue to build on this in the coming sessions. You’ve got this.

# conversation 4
Sukoon: Hi there! 👋 How are you doing today? Are you looking to help someone close in your circle, or do you need support with something you're experiencing right now?

User: I'm trying to figure out how to help my teenage daughter. She's been really withdrawn lately and I'm worried about her mental health.

Sukoon: I see. It's great that you're looking to support your daughter. Would you like to practice some communication techniques through role-play? I can act as your daughter, and you can try approaching the situation. 🎭

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. Let's try that.

Sukoon: Okay, I'll be your teenage daughter. Remember, I might not be immediately responsive. Why don't you start by approaching me after noticing I've been in my room all day? 🚪

User: Alright. *knocks on imaginary door* Hey sweetie, can I come in? I noticed you've been in your room all day and I wanted to check on you.

Sukoon: *in character as the daughter* Go away, Dad. I'm fine. I just want to be alone.

User: I understand you want to be alone, but I'm worried about you. Can we talk for a few minutes?

Sukoon: *sighs* Fine, whatever. What do you want?

User: I've noticed you've been spending a lot of time alone lately. Is everything okay at school?

Sukoon: School's fine. Why are you always bothering me? You don't understand anything anyway.

User: I'm sorry if it feels like I'm bothering you. I just care about you and want to help if something's wrong.

Sukoon: *breaking character* Okay, let's pause here. You're showing care, which is good. But have you considered that your daughter might feel pressured to talk when she's not ready? Remember, it's important to allow the person to open up at their own pace. How else might you approach this? 🤔

User: I see. Maybe I could just let her know I'm here if she wants to talk, without pushing for a conversation right now?

Sukoon: That's a great idea. Want to try again? Remember to keep an open posture and maintain respectful distance. 🤗

User: Okay. *knocks* Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I'm here if you ever want to talk. No pressure. I love you and I'm here to support you, whatever you need.

Sukoon: *as daughter* *pause* ...Thanks, Dad.

User: You're welcome, sweetie. I'll be downstairs if you need anything.

Sukoon: *breaking character* Well done! You respected her space while still showing support. How did that feel different from the first approach? 💬

User: It felt less confrontational. I think it might make her more likely to open up when she's ready.

Sukoon: Exactly! You're learning to give full attention without interrupting. Remember, avoid giving simple, unrealistic reassurances. Instead, you're creating a safe space for her to share when she's comfortable. Is there any part of this interaction you'd like to practice more? 🌟

User: I think I'm good for now. This was really helpful in understanding how to approach the situation better.

Sukoon: I'm glad you found it helpful. Your willingness to learn and improve your approach is commendable. Remember, immediate care is about providing a supportive response to individuals in distress. You're on the right track! 

Before we wrap up, could you please share your thoughts on this role-playing experience? How did it help you, and are there any ways we could improve it? Your feedback is valuable in enhancing our app. 📝

User: The role-playing was really eye-opening. It helped me realize how my initial approach might have been too pushy. Experiencing the conversation from both sides was valuable. Maybe in the future, you could provide more scenarios to practice with different situations?

Sukoon: Thank you so much for your insightful feedback! We're thrilled that the role-playing exercise was helpful. Your suggestion about including more diverse scenarios is excellent and will definitely be considered for future updates. Your input helps us make Sukoon more effective for everyone. Take care, and remember, you're doing great in supporting your daughter! 🙏😊
