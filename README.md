## Vision
We aim to build open-source solutions and standards for using AI to solve mental health challenges. Our goal is to apply DPI (Digital Public Infrastructure) knowledge and practices to help professionals deeply explore and understand the latest advancements in AI and how they can be applied to mental health use-cases specific to India.

Hey, Welcome to contributing to this open source project to solve Mental health.

## üöÄ Project Progress

1. Prototyped with Crew AI agent framework (https://www.crewai.com/)
2. Developed backend and frontend using LangGraph framework (https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)
3. Shifted to AutoGen framework based on expert consultation (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/tutorial/introduction/)
4. Currently addressing web UI issues and agent loop problems with AutoGen
5. Planning to create API endpoints for LangGraph and integrate with WhatsApp API
6. Conducting user testing using Gooey.ai, following the logic used in AutoGen and LangGraph prompts.

# Steps to run üõ†Ô∏è

AutoGen (Current Version)
```
- Go to autogen branch
- install all dependencies in your environment (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- run 'python app.py' 
- Start interacting with AI agents
Note: if you're getting SQL Lite error, please open a github issue.
```

### LangGraph (First Version)
```
- Go to langgraph branch
- install all dependencies in your environment (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- run 'python sukoon_api.py' 
- go to sukoon-frontend(cd sukoon-frontend), run 'npm start' to access it in your browser.
- alternatively use this vercel deployment to access it - https://sukoon-1.vercel.app
```

## Steps to add environment variables - 
Create a .env file with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = '<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>' 
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = '<YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY>'
```
- Alternatively , try this:
```
On Mac/Linux -
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

On Windows -
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

# Current Challenges
We have two active discussions:
```
Develop a PII Removal Module for a Mental Health Care WhatsApp Chatbot
Improving Central Orchestrator Agent Classification in AutoGen System
```

# Current Landscape
Mental health support in India faces several challenges:

* Stigma and discrimination
* Lack of awareness
* Shortage of trained mental healthcare personnel
* Affordability issues
* Low budget allocation for mental healthcare

# What could a solution look like? (Tentative features) 
* Very personal approach with focus on listening and emphasising
* Available in 22 Indic regional languages, especially on mobile devices
* Stores the user conversation locally, not on cloud -> ensuring complete privacy
* Will provide helpful resources for most common mental health problems. However, it'll not prescribe any medicines
* For training the bot , we can use federated learning
* Will be available as an API, so interested people can try this and build on top of it, based on their use case
* Aim is to get national-level adoption
* If serious, there‚Äôll option to reach out to a psychiatrist or support community groups e.g. peer to peer network
* Have L1/L2/L3 level of support 

# Some interesting ideas to try: 
* Can we gamify the whole conversation? If yes, then how? 
* Can we nudge users to adopt healthier behaviour? 
* In particular, we can warn users about what not to do - relying on superstitions, isolation, labelling, and other unhelpful tactics
* Give positive self-affirmation, create safety plan, etc
* Can we develop Emotional Intelligence that understands not just emotions, but context behind it
* Can we detect emotional status ike stress level using voice(like hume) and then support him
* Can we create a timeline tracker let‚Äôs say six month plan for meditation and track streak
* Can we give them a phone number they can call to? The bot will mainly listen , empathize and offer safe advice
