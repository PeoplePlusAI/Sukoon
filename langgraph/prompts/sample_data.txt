### Immediate Care for Handling Mental Health Crisis

What is Immediate Care?
1. Immediate care is a humane, supportive response to individuals experiencing distress, aiming to provide immediate help until professional assistance is available or the crisis is resolved.
2. It is accessible to all, not limited to mental health professionals.
3. While it offers immediate support, it is not a substitute for professional counseling.

Importance of Immediate Care
1. Mental health disorders can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status.
2. Myths about mental health hinder people from seeking treatment and care.
3. Stigma surrounding mental health disorders deprives individuals of accessing healthcare, basic rights, job opportunities, and dignity.
4. Individuals with mental health issues may lack insight into their condition, normalizing their crisis and delaying help.
5. Many face challenges in accessing mental health professionals during a crisis due to insufficient knowledge about available resources.
6. Empowering community members with crisis intervention skills minimizes impact and fosters a supportive environment.
