Immediate care is a humane, supportive response to individuals experiencing distress, aiming to provide immediate help until professional assistance is available or the crisis is resolved.\n2. It is accessible to all, not limited to mental health professionals.\n3. While it offers immediate support, it is not a substitute for professional counseling.\n\nImportance of Immediate Care\n1. Mental health disorders can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status.\n2. Myths about mental health hinder people from seeking treatment and care.\n3. Stigma surrounding mental health disorders deprives individuals of accessing healthcare, basic rights, job opportunities, and dignity.\n4. Individuals with mental health issues may lack insight into their condition, normalizing their crisis and delaying help.\n5. Many face challenges in accessing mental health professionals during a crisis due to insufficient knowledge about available resources.\n6. Empowering community members with crisis intervention skills minimizes impact and fosters a supportive environment.\n\nDifference between Immediate Care and Psychological First Aid (PFA)\n- Immediate Care:\n  1. Addresses short-term crises and everyday stressors.\n  2. Community-based and easily accessible.\n- Psychological First Aid (PFA):\n  1. Targets severe, long-lasting problems.\n  2. Requires trained professionals and controlled environments.\n\nWho Can Provide Immediate Care?\n- Community members\n- Mental health professionals\n- Police\n- Emergency medical teams\n- Counselors\n- Neighbors\n- NGOs\n- Relatives or family members\n\nWhat is Mental Health Crisis?\n1. Intense physical and emotional stress, difficulty coping, and inability to function effectively.\n2. Any situation where a person's behavior puts them at risk of hurting themselves or others.\n\nLife Span Model of Mental Health Crisis\n- Childhood: Bullying, separation from parents, parental disharmony, peer pressure, child abuse, sibling rivalry, academic pressure, physical illness/disability, death of a family member.\n- Adolescence: Identity crisis, sexual abuse, menarche, body image issues, substance use, relationship failures, technology addiction, career issues.\n- Young Adulthood: Migration, higher education, technology addiction, loss of job, loss of loved ones, workplace stress, pregnancy-related events, marital issues, career issues, parenting, financial issues.\n- Middle Age: Family issues, divorce, death of spouse, physical illness, children's marriage decisions, property issues, health issues, empty nest.\n- Old Age: Retirement, health issues, dependency, caregiving, loss of spouse, stress of unfinished business, issues in interpersonal relationships, isolation, social support, mobility.\n\nImmediate Care During Disasters\n1. Common Reactions:\n   - Emotional: Sadness, crying spells, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, hopelessness, sensitivity to criticism, anger, aggression.\n   - Physical: Tiredness, increased heartbeat, sweating, shaking, weight changes, headaches, body aches, digestive problems.\n   - Behavioral: Social withdrawal, changes in sleep or appetite, increased substance use, acting out of character.\n   - Cognitive: Difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts, forgetfulness, negative thinking patterns.\n\nHow to Approach Someone in Crisis\n1. Notice signs and approach with care to establish rapport.\n2. Engage the person in conversation about what could be bothering them.\n3. Allow the person to choose when to open up.\n4. Express concern and willingness to help.\n5. Respect how the person interprets their symptoms.\n6. Give full attention and listen without interrupting.\n7. Avoid giving simple, unrealistic reassurances.\n\nAnatomy of a First Aider\n- Face the speaker, keep open posture, lean slightly forward, maintain eye contact.\n- Avoid physical contact unless appropriate, maintain respectful distance.\n- Building skills: undivided concentration, mindful presence, nonverbal cues, active listening.\n- Empathy: Express care, supportive statements, ask questions, paraphrase, acknowledge emotions.\n- Be non-judgmental: Treat with respect, avoid evaluative comments, maintain a neutral facial expression.\n\nClarifying Confidentiality\n- Reflect the speaker's words and feelings to ensure correct understanding.\n- Summarize what has been shared to clarify.\n- Always ask for permission before sharing any information.\n\nProbing Skills\n- Use open-ended questions to encourage exploration.\n- Avoid \"why\" questions, use pauses or silence.\n- Emphasize \"I\" messages over \"you\" messages.\n\nWhat Immediate Care is Not\n- It is not obtaining details of traumatic experiences, treating, labeling or diagnosing, counseling, or something only professionals can do.\n\nDon'ts in Immediate Care\n- Do not pressure someone to tell their story.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4864, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2a3e62e-796a-4d57-9d89-92d937e98c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2a3e62e-796a-4d57-9d89-92d937e98c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/leader/Downloads/AI_Army/ML_Basics/NLP/My_ChatBot/AI_agents/Sukoon_Github/langgraph/prompts/sample_data.txt", "file_name": "sample_data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5100, "creation_date": "2024-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fcf383f1-14bf-42de-8764-d9d7a9626c5d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/leader/Downloads/AI_Army/ML_Basics/NLP/My_ChatBot/AI_agents/Sukoon_Github/langgraph/prompts/sample_data.txt", "file_name": "sample_data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5100, "creation_date": "2024-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "2eb1b839006ff0b4b60105f1ac6582cf6e98a09ce6453e7b0025456339829c05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2874d249-b6a1-492e-b3a6-9dfcfe5ceae6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/leader/Downloads/AI_Army/ML_Basics/NLP/My_ChatBot/AI_agents/Sukoon_Github/langgraph/prompts/sample_data.txt", "file_name": "sample_data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5100, "creation_date": "2024-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "951c1f77849d43d7358ba7d3fc9473fd77e6becf4a690eab48a80bab9b6951d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- Avoid physical contact unless appropriate, maintain respectful distance.\n- Building skills: undivided concentration, mindful presence, nonverbal cues, active listening.\n- Empathy: Express care, supportive statements, ask questions, paraphrase, acknowledge emotions.\n- Be non-judgmental: Treat with respect, avoid evaluative comments, maintain a neutral facial expression.\n\nClarifying Confidentiality\n- Reflect the speaker's words and feelings to ensure correct understanding.\n- Summarize what has been shared to clarify.\n- Always ask for permission before sharing any information.\n\nProbing Skills\n- Use open-ended questions to encourage exploration.\n- Avoid \"why\" questions, use pauses or silence.\n- Emphasize \"I\" messages over \"you\" messages.\n\nWhat Immediate Care is Not\n- It is not obtaining details of traumatic experiences, treating, labeling or diagnosing, counseling, or something only professionals can do.\n\nDon'ts in Immediate Care\n- Do not pressure someone to tell their story.\n- Do not interrupt or rush the story.\n- Do not give simple, unrealistic reassurances.\n- Do not give false promises or minimize their loss.\n- Do not touch if unsure, and avoid criticizing existing services in front of people in need.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3876, "end_char_idx": 5097, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"fcf383f1-14bf-42de-8764-d9d7a9626c5d": {"node_ids": ["2874d249-b6a1-492e-b3a6-9dfcfe5ceae6", "f2a3e62e-796a-4d57-9d89-92d937e98c08"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/leader/Downloads/AI_Army/ML_Basics/NLP/My_ChatBot/AI_agents/Sukoon_Github/langgraph/prompts/sample_data.txt", "file_name": "sample_data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5100, "creation_date": "2024-07-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}}}}
