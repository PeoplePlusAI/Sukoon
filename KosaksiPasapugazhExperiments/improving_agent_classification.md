# Scenario Overview
In our Multi-Agent System, the Central Orchestrator Agent plays a crucial role in analyzing incoming queries and delegating tasks to appropriate specialized agents. Recently, we've observed a concerning trend of misclassifications, leading to suboptimal task routing and inefficient use of our specialized agents.

## The Problem
The Central Orchestrator Agent is currently experiencing difficulties in accurately categorizing complex, multifaceted queries. This misclassification results in:

1. Inappropriate agent selection for certain tasks.
2. Inefficient use of system resources.
3. Longer processing times for queries.
4. Potential errors in final outputs due to mismatched expertise.

These issues are particularly pronounced when dealing with queries that span multiple domains or require nuanced understanding of context.

## Guiding Questions
To help you approach this task systematically, consider the following questions:

1. What patterns do you observe in the types of queries that are most frequently misclassified?
2. How does the current classification algorithm work? What are its strengths and limitations?
3. Are there any biases in the training data that might be affecting the agent's decision-making?
4. How can we incorporate context and multi-domain understanding into the classification process?
5. What additional metadata or information could be helpful in improving classification accuracy?
6. How might we implement a confidence score for the agent's classifications, and how could this be used in the routing process?
7. Are there opportunities for implementing a feedback loop to continuously improve classification accuracy over time?

## Expected Deliverables
1. A detailed analysis of the current classification system and its shortcomings.
2. Proposed improvements to the classification algorithm, including any necessary changes to the agent's architecture.
3. A plan for gathering and incorporating more comprehensive metadata for incoming queries.
4. Suggestions for implementing a multi-stage classification process for complex queries.
5. A proposed method for measuring and monitoring classification accuracy over time.

## Additional Considerations
1. Consider the trade-offs between classification accuracy and processing speed. How can we balance these factors?
2. Think about how we can make the classification process more transparent and explainable, both for system audits and for user understanding.
3. Consider the scalability of your proposed solutions as the system grows and handles an increasing variety of query types.
